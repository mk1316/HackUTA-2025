## Troubleshooting

### Audio still not working after adding API key?

1. **Check API key format**: Should start with `sk_`
2. **Restart dev server**: Stop and start `npm run dev`
3. **Check browser console**: Press F12 â†’ Console tab for errors
4. **Verify account**: Make sure your ElevenLabs account is active

### "Failed to generate audio" error?

- Check that you haven't exceeded your monthly character limit
- Verify the API key is valid and not expired
- Check your internet connection

---

**Note**: The audio feature is optional. You can still use all other features (PDF processing, calendar export, etc.) without an ElevenLabs API key!
