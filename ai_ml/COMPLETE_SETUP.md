# 🎉 Homebrew Successfully Installed! Complete Setup Guide

## ✅ **Great News: Homebrew is Installed!**

I can see from your terminal that Homebrew has been successfully installed. Now we just need to add it to your PATH and install the remaining dependencies.

## 🔧 **Step 1: Add Homebrew to PATH**

Run these commands exactly as shown:

```bash
echo >> /Users/arnissama/.zprofile
echo 'eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"' >> /Users/arnissama/.zprofile
eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
```

## 🍺 **Step 2: Verify Homebrew is Working**

```bash
brew --version
```

You should see something like: `Homebrew 4.x.x`

## 🔍 **Step 3: Install Tesseract OCR**

```bash
brew install tesseract
```

## 🐍 **Step 4: Install Python Dependencies**

```bash
# Navigate to AI/ML directory
cd /Users/arnissama/Desktop/HACKUTA/NLP/ai_ml

# Install Python packages
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🚀 **Step 5: Run the Application**

```bash
# Set API key (optional - for AI features)
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'

# Run the application
python3 main.py
```

## 🧪 **Step 6: Test Everything is Working**

### **Test Tesseract:**
```bash
tesseract --version
```

### **Test Python Dependencies:**
```bash
python3 -c "import pdfplumber, pytesseract, fastapi; print('✅ All dependencies installed')"
```

### **Test the Application:**
```bash
# In another terminal, test the API
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## 🌐 **Access Your Application**

Once running, your AI/ML syllabus parser will be available at:
- **API**: http://localhost:8000
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8000/health
- **API Documentation**: http://localhost:8000/docs
- **Sample Courses**: http://localhost:8000/courses/sample

## 🎯 **Expected Success Output**

When everything is working, you should see:
```
INFO:     Started server process
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8000
```

## 🧪 **Test Commands**

### **Health Check:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

### **Test Sample Parse:**
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/test/parse-sample
```

### **View Sample Courses:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/courses/sample
```
